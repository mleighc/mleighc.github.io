I am a **data analyst** and **systems builder** who got into tech after several years in nonprofit fundraising operations, where I spent a lot of time managing messy spreadsheets and trying to make broken processes work. Eventually, I realized what I really wanted was to fix the system itself, not just clean up after it.    

I made the pivot into data analytics a few years ago, and since then, I’ve been focused on building tools that make work smoother, clearer, and less redundant. These days, I work at the **University of Michigan’s Alzheimer’s Disease Center**, where I manage the data infrastructure behind our research systems, connecting tools like REDCap, SharePoint, R, and Power Automate to help data move cleanly between teams and projects.     
    
What sets me apart isn’t just technical fluency, it’s the ability to see both the big picture and the system underneath.     
    
**I diagram, debug, and document.**      
     
I build with the end user in mind. And I never stop asking: *How could this be easier, clearer, or more scalable?*    
     
On the side, I run a small business called SMPL Sheets that transforms public directories into clean, CRM-ready datasets, and a print-on-demand project called Fluffy Feeling Co., because automation can be fun, too.
