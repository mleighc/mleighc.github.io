    "text": "Hi, I’m Miranda!\nI’m a data analyst and programmer with a passion for creating solutions that simplify complex problems. With a Master’s in Data Analytics from the University of Michigan, I work at the intersection of data, process automation, and creative problem-solving. My experience ranges from streamlining workflows and automating business processes at the University of Michigan Alzheimer’s Disease Center to designing simple, user-friendly tools that improve efficiency.\nAt the Alzheimer’s Disease Center, I’ve led projects to build participant management systems, automate data flow, and improve research workflows, always with an eye toward practical, scalable solutions. I’m comfortable working with R, Python, Microsoft Power Automate, and other tools to design systems that make processes more efficient and accessible.\nIn addition to my professional work, I’m also an entrepreneur, running Fluffy Feeling Co., an Etsy shop where I create fun, animal-themed products. This outlet allows me to merge my analytical skills with creativity, whether it’s automating order processes or designing unique items.\nI’m dedicated to learning and solving problems with both technical skills and a creative approach. I strive to make things simpler and more effective, whether it’s optimizing systems or creating new products. If you need someone who combines data-driven insights with a thoughtful, hands-on approach, I’d love to collaborate."
