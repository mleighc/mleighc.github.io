Eventually, I realized what I really wanted was to fix the system itself, not just clean up after it.\nI made the pivot into data analytics a few years ago, and since then, I’ve been focused on building tools that make work smoother, clearer, and less redundant. These days, I work at the University of Michigan’s Alzheimer’s Disease Center, where I manage the data infrastructure behind our research systems, connecting tools like REDCap, SharePoint, R, and Power Automate to help data move cleanly between teams and projects.\nWhat sets me apart isn’t just technical fluency, it’s the ability to see both the big picture and the system underneath.\nI diagram, debug, and document.\nI build with the end user in mind. And I never stop asking: How could this be easier, clearer, or more scalable?\nOn the side, I run a small business called SMPL Sheets that transforms public directories into clean, CRM-ready datasets, and a print-on-demand project called Fluffy Feeling Co., because automation can be fun, too.\n\n\n Back to top"

That resonates with the kind of audit trails and validation steps I’ve been trying to build into our systems.\nPlatform thinking is on the rise: teams are moving away from isolated dashboards or tools and toward end-to-end coordination. That aligns with how I’ve been approaching our internal research systems: not as one-off solutions, but as interconnected parts of a broader flow.\nThe shift in data governance conversations: from rigid gatekeeping to embedded structure that supports collaboration. That one felt particularly relevant. We’re still figuring this out in practice, but I like the reframing: governance not as a blocker, but as scaffolding.\n\nEven though the article is targeted at large-scale teams and enterprise systems, there’s a lot that still applies when you’re a smaller team trying to build with longevity and clarity in mind.\n\nThis post builds on a recent LinkedIn #BookmarkDive reflection, feel free to join the conversation there."

Jenny brings a grounded, candid energy to technical topics that could otherwise feel dry or overwhelming. She shared moments from her own transitions, from academia to software engineering, and it was validating to hear how much she gravitated toward the building and tinkering aspects of her work.

For someone so recognizable in the Posit ecosystem, she spoke with clarity about knowing who she is and the kind of work she wants to be doing. That’s the kind of career clarity I aspire to, and the kind of example I appreciate as I carve out my own path.\nThis is something I’ve been reflecting on a lot lately, especially as I learn out loud and try to build systems that can grow with me.

But reframing it as a form of self-documentation, not self-promotion, is helping. Im creating a quiet archive of growth, that might just be useful to someone else down the line too. Check out the Projects page of this site to see where I’m at so far in my journey to document my work experience and learning process.\nAnd I’m starting to shape these reflections into something more structured, a beginner-friendly guide called “Zero to Quarto in 14 Days” for anyone who’s been stuck at “I should really make a portfolio” and wants to get one live on GitHub in just a couple weeks with some straightforward guides to help navigate the process. I’ll share it on the Learn with Me page once it’s ready.\n\nThis post builds on a recent LinkedIn #BookmarkDive reflection, feel free to join the conversation there."

You could apply the exact same process in R, Python, SQL, or Excel, the core ideas are all about intentional, structured thinking.\nSome solid reminders:\n\nStart by actually looking at your dataset. Dimensions, types, nulls, duplicates, don’t skip the orientation.\nDon’t treat missing data like an afterthought. Handle it with intention based on context.\nEncode categorical variables early and deliberately. It’ll save you pain later.\nCheck your assumptions with basic summaries, sometimes the weirdness is obvious if you pause to look.\nModularize your cleaning steps. If you build them clearly, you can reuse them across projects.\n\nIt’s not fancy, but that’s the point. There’s something satisfying about a clean, thoughtful approach that isn’t trying to be clever, just effective. I’ve found this kind of steady rhythm in cleaning always pays off, especially when I come back to a dataset weeks or months later and can still follow my own trail.\n\nThis post builds on a recent LinkedIn #BookmarkDive reflection, feel free to join the conversation there."

I still have a barebones repo sitting quietly in a corner of GitLab, mostly utility functions I use daily to pull and wrangle research data, but this site has stayed in the back of my mind as one of those “when I’m ready to level this up” references.\nEven though I’m not actively building a package yet, revisiting this reminded me that there’s a whole ecosystem out there built to support that leap. It’s not just about having the right tools, it’s about seeing the path forward, even if you’re coming from an analyst background.\nWhat I like about this collection is that it doesn’t just list libraries, it actually walks you through how to think like a package developer, with guidance on structure, testing, documentation, and deployment.\nA few tools that stood out:\n\n{usethis} for scaffolding structure and setup, a lifesaver for project hygiene.\n{testthat} for building tests as I go (aspirational, but I’m trying).\n{pkgdown} for instantly making docs more shareable and browsable.\n{fledge} to automate changelogs and version bumps without the fuss.\nGitHub Actions templates for keeping tests and builds running smoothly behind the scenes.\n\nComing back to this list was a good reminder that if and when I do move forward with turning our internal scripts into something more formal and reusable, I won’t have to start from scratch. From scaffolding to polish to automation, it’s all here when I’m ready.\n\nThis post builds on a recent LinkedIn #BookmarkDive reflection, feel free to join the conversation there.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Folder organization, file naming, and code modularity all impact how easily others (and future-you) can navigate the work.\nCommunication isn’t extra: comments, documentation, audit trails, they are the work.

It’s not a replacement for domain expertise, and it can’t fix a broken process. But when used thoughtfully, it can act like a teammate, a second brain to bounce ideas off of or prototype something before it’s fully formed.\nFor me, the goal isn’t to use AI for everything.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Project Overview\nThe MADC Study Suggester is an R script developed for the Michigan Alzheimer’s Disease Center (MADC) to help match participants with appropriate studies based on their specific criteria. The script gathers participant and study data, filters the available studies, and generates a list of recommended studies for each participant. The aim of this tool is to streamline the process of study selection, ensuring that participants are matched with studies that are relevant to their health status and research goals. The output of the script is a user-friendly, formatted PDF report that displays the study recommendations in a clear table. The script uses gt for creating well-structured tables, webshot2 for capturing snapshots, and pagedown for converting the results into a high-quality, printable PDF format.\n\n\nKey Accomplishments\n\nR Script Development:\n\nDeveloped an R script that gathers and filters participant and study data to generate study recommendations tailored to each participant’s specific criteria.\n\nOutput Generation:\n\nUsed gt to create structured, user-friendly tables and pagedown to convert the tables into high-quality, printable PDF reports.\n\nTools and Libraries:\n\nIntegrated webshot2 for snapshot generation and pagedown for rendering the final output as a PDF, enhancing the accessibility and presentation of the data.\n\nStreamlining Study Selection:\n\nThe tool improves the process of identifying appropriate studies for participants, saving time for researchers and ensuring better matching between participants and studies.\n\nCurrent Status:\n\nThe script is operational, providing formatted PDF outputs that are ready for use by MADC team members.\n\n\nDue to HIPAA regulations, I am not able to share the source code or sample output files.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "This project, initiated on March 28, 2024, is an ongoing development with phased releases of features. The aim of the PEARL system (Participant Engagement and Research Lifecycle) is to improve participant visit tracking and engagement across 10+ research studies at the University of Michigan Alzheimer’s Disease Center.\nPEARL is designed as a network of interconnected lists, where each list represents a specific study. This network is intended to help participant and visit data flow seamlessly across co-enrolling studies, making it easier to manage participants who are enrolled in multiple studies simultaneously. By developing a modular workflow for each study, PEARL allows for customization to meet the needs of individual research projects while maintaining an integrated, scalable system.\nTo date, we have developed and implemented a list for the University of Michigan Memory and Aging Project (UMMAP) study, with plans to scale this system across all studies at the center. Power Automate is being used to connect data across these lists, ensuring smooth communication and data synchronization between the studies. Automated notifications are also incorporated to streamline task management and participant tracking."
