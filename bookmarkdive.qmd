A curated trail of the resources, tools, and reflections shaping how I think about data, systems, and building things that last.

Every post starts with something Iâ€™ve saved (a newsletter, a code snippet, a talk, a blog post) and ends with a short reflection on why it resonated, what I took away, or how I might use it. This series helps me stay grounded in my learning and make space for slow, intentional exploration, even when life and work move fast.

Some entries are technical. Some are reflective. All of them mark a breadcrumb in my journey toward better data practice, deeper thinking, and more sustainable growth.
