## Project Overview

In this project, I developed a workflow and participant management tool leveraging a network of lists in Microsoft Lists/Sharepoint to improve participant visit tracking across 10+ research studies.

## Key achievements

- Creating modular workflows for study customization.
- Integrating Power Automate for data flow and notifications.
- Improving participant engagement metrics.

## Key Technologies
- Microsoft Lists
- Power Automate
- SharePoint

Due to HIPAA regulations, I am only able to share a sandbox copy of the original system.
