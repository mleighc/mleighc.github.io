## Project Overview

This project is still a work in progress with phased releases of features. It was initiated on March 28, 2024 and is still in development.

In this project, I developed a workflow and participant management tool leveraging a network of lists in Microsoft Lists/Sharepoint to improve participant visit tracking across 10+ research studies.

## Key Achievements

- Creating modular workflows for study customization.
- Integrating Power Automate for data flow and notifications.
- Improving participant engagement metrics.

Due to HIPAA regulations, I am only able to share a sandbox copy of the original system.
