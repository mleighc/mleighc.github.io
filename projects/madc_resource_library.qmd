## Project Overview
I led the development of an online resource site for the Michigan Alzheimer's Disease Center's (MADC) Data Core. This site is designed to provide a growing collection of technical resources to help onboard new and current staff, improving their skills for day-to-day operations. I utilized Quarto's book infrastructure to compile the resources and successfully deployed the site using Quarto Pub, enabling seamless updates after each commit.

## Key Accomplishments
- Developed and launched an online technical resources site for MADC's Data Core staff.
- Utilized Quartoâ€™s book infrastructure to structure and organize content effectively.
- Automated site deployment to Quarto Pub after each commit by writing and configuring a YAML file.
- Ensured the site remains up-to-date and easily accessible to staff for continuous learning and skill-building.
