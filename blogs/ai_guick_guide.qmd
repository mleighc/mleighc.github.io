Weâ€™re in this moment where everyoneâ€™s trying to figure out what AI means for their work. Some folks are exploring new tools, some are worried about what it might take away. Personally, Iâ€™ve found AI to be an enhancement, a way to:

- synthesize my thoughts more quickly
- automate tedious parts of my workflow
- free up more time for the kind of thinking and systems design I actually want to do

This [guide by Ethan Mollick](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/using-ai-right-now-a-quick-guide) is one I bookmarked for its clarity and practicality. It walks through how to use AI in your day-to-day work *right now* without hype or fearmongering.

## Reflections

One of the key takeaways from the article is that prompting isnâ€™t a party trick, itâ€™s a skill to develop. The way you frame a question or structure a task can completely change the output you get. Thatâ€™s been especially true in my own work, where I use AI tools not just to save time, but to think more clearly, draft early versions of tricky documentation, or get unstuck in a coding problem.

Mollickâ€™s breakdown of where AI *doesnâ€™t* add value is also refreshing. Itâ€™s not a replacement for domain expertise, and it canâ€™t fix a broken process. But when used thoughtfully, it can act like a teammate, a second brain to bounce ideas off of or prototype something before itâ€™s fully formed.

For me, the goal isnâ€™t to use AI for everything. Itâ€™s to use it well, where it makes sense, and where it supports my broader intentions: clarity, creativity, and sustainable systems.
