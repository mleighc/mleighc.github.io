This is one of those classic GitHub resources I bookmarked a long time ago but only recently gave a proper look. Iâ€™ve been in the process of refining which tools I actually want in my workflow, and this list has been a great companion for that.

ðŸ“Œ [Awesome Python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python)

> A curated list of Python libraries and tools, organized by use case, from data science and web frameworks to testing, CLI apps, and DevOps.

## Reflections

What I appreciate about this list is how easy it makes it to **scan the landscape** without falling into a documentation spiral. When you're trying to compare tools or see what's out there beyond the defaults, it's incredibly useful to have a high-level reference like this.

Why I keep coming back to it:

- Itâ€™s **organized by category**, so you can zero in on what youâ€™re actually trying to do (APIs, file handling, dashboards, testing, etc.). I think this helps a bit with the "drinking from a firehose feeling".
- It surfaces **lesser-known but powerful libraries** that donâ€™t always show up in Google or StackOverflow searches.
- Itâ€™s a solid reminder of **how wide the Python ecosystem really is**, and how much already exists, especially when youâ€™re tempted to write something from scratch.

I plan to start looking back at this more frequently as I clean up my own Python stack, deciding whatâ€™s core, whatâ€™s project-specific, and whatâ€™s just good to know exists when the right use case comes up.
