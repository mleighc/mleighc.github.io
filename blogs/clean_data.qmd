Came across this article again while skimming through my old bookmarks. I remembered liking it the first time around for how grounded and practical it was â€” and it still holds up.

ðŸ“Œ [So Youâ€™ve Got a Dataset. Hereâ€™s How You Clean It.](https://towardsdatascience.com/so-youve-got-a-dataset-here-s-how-you-clean-it-5d0b04a2ed86)

> A step-by-step mindset for approaching data cleaning, by Ang Li-Lian.

## Reflections

What I appreciate about this piece is that itâ€™s not tied to a specific tool or language. You could apply the exact same process in R, Python, SQL, or Excel, the core ideas are all about intentional, structured thinking.

Some solid reminders:

- Start by actually looking at your dataset. Dimensions, types, nulls, duplicates, donâ€™t skip the orientation.
- Donâ€™t treat missing data like an afterthought. Handle it with intention based on context.
- Encode categorical variables early and deliberately. Itâ€™ll save you pain later.
- Check your assumptions with basic summaries, sometimes the weirdness is obvious if you pause to look.
- Modularize your cleaning steps. If you build them clearly, you can reuse them across projects.

Itâ€™s not fancy, but thatâ€™s the point. Thereâ€™s something satisfying about a clean, thoughtful approach that isnâ€™t trying to be clever, just effective. Iâ€™ve found this kind of steady rhythm in cleaning always pays off, especially when I come back to a dataset weeks or months later and can still follow my own trail.
