Not totally sure where I first stumbled across this one, but itâ€™s a tool Iâ€™ve bookmarked and revisited more than once, especially as Iâ€™ve been cleaning up and refining some of my own repos.

> Auto-generates a structured wiki-style summary for any public GitHub repo, think dependencies, architecture, key components, and usage insights.

## Reflections

What stood out to me about Deepwiki is how much context it manages to surface from a repo without you having to dig through every file. Iâ€™ve run it on a few of my own personal projects recently and was genuinely impressed by how clearly it summarized the intent, layout, and dependencies in a way that made me rethink how I structure READMEs.

Itâ€™s helpful for:

- Auditing your own repos, making sure structure, naming, and purpose are legible to others.
- Learning from unfamiliar codebases, seeing how other tools are organized before diving into the weeds.
- Just exploring: their homepage is full of commonly-used open-source projects (like [VS Code](https://deepwiki.com/microsoft/vscode)) that are fun to browse through from a systems-thinking perspective.

Iâ€™ve started using Deepwiki as a bit of a litmus test: does my repo make sense at a glance? Would someone new to the project understand what theyâ€™re looking at? And if not, what small tweaks would improve it?
