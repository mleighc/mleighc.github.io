I saved this article as I started thinking more seriously about how to not just build skills, but actually show the work Iâ€™m doing. That doesnâ€™t come naturally to me. Iâ€™ve always been more comfortable behind the scenes: building systems, cleaning messy data, connecting dots. Not so much broadcasting the results.

But the more I grow in my career, the more I realize how important visibility is. Especially in data, where most of the work is invisible unless you choose to surface it.

This guide from Coursera is geared toward early-career analysts, but a few reminders really landed for me:
- Your portfolio doesnâ€™t need to be fancy â€” just clear and intentional
- Context matters more than polish
- It can track what youâ€™re learning, not just what youâ€™ve mastered
- Itâ€™s not only for job searching â€” itâ€™s a form of reflection

## Reflections

This piece gave me permission to loosen up a bit, to treat my portfolio less like a high-stakes project and more like documentation. Not just for hiring managers, but for myself. A living space to track how I think, what Iâ€™m building, and how Iâ€™m evolving.

Iâ€™m still figuring out what that looks like in practice. But reframing it as a form of self-documentation, not self-promotion, is helping. Im creating a quiet archive of growth, that might just be useful to someone else down the line too.
