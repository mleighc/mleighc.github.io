I saved this article as I started thinking more seriously about how to not just build skills, but actually show the work I‚Äôm doing. That doesn‚Äôt come naturally to me. I‚Äôve always been more comfortable behind the scenes: building systems, cleaning messy data, connecting dots. Not so much broadcasting the results.

But the more I grow in my career, the more I realize how important visibility is. Especially in data, where most of the work is invisible unless you choose to surface it.

This guide from Coursera is geared toward early-career analysts, but a few reminders really landed for me:

- Your portfolio doesn‚Äôt need to be fancy, just clear and intentional
- Context matters more than polish
- It can track what you‚Äôre learning, not just what you‚Äôve mastered
- It‚Äôs not only for job searching, it‚Äôs a form of reflection

## Reflections

This piece gave me permission to loosen up a bit, to treat my portfolio less like a high-stakes project and more like documentation. Not just for hiring managers, but for myself. A living space to track how I think, what I‚Äôm building, and how I‚Äôm evolving.

I‚Äôm still figuring out what that looks like in practice. But reframing it as a form of self-documentation, not self-promotion, is helping. Im creating a quiet archive of growth, that might just be useful to someone else down the line too. Check out the [Projects](https://mleighc.github.io/projects.html) page of this site to see where I'm at so far in my journey to document my work experience and learning process.

And I‚Äôm starting to shape these reflections into something more structured, a beginner-friendly guide called "**Zero to Quarto in 14 Days**" for anyone who‚Äôs been stuck at ‚ÄúI should really make a portfolio‚Äù and wants to get one live on GitHub in just a couple weeks with some straightforward guides to help navigate the process. I‚Äôll share it on the [Learn with Me](https://mleighc.github.io/learn.html) page once it‚Äôs ready.
