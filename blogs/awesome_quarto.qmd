Now that Iâ€™ve been using Quarto more regularly, both for my own portfolio and for my teamâ€™s open science site, I wanted to come back to this resource I saved early on but never really dug into until now.

ðŸ“Œ [Awesome Quarto](https://github.com/mcanouil/awesome-quarto)

> A curated list of templates, extensions, showcase sites, and documentation examples for the Quarto ecosystem.

## Reflections

When I first bookmarked this, Quarto still felt like a shiny new toy I hadnâ€™t quite made space for. I skimmed it, bookmarked it, and figured Iâ€™d circle back eventually. Now that itâ€™s become part of my real workflow, especially for publishing documentation and building out multi-page sites, Iâ€™m seeing this collection in a whole new light.

Thereâ€™s a lot here, but a few areas Iâ€™m especially interested in as I keep building:

- **Multi-page layouts** that feel clean and navigable (especially for guides and internal documentation)
- **Publishing workflows**, what people are automating, and how theyâ€™re doing it
- **Embedded visualizations** and examples that go beyond static charts
- How folks are structuring content for **collaboration and reuse**, something Iâ€™m thinking a lot about as I try to make my scripts and documents more legible to teammates

Iâ€™ve been slowly building up my own library of snippets, templates, and patterns, and this repo is a good reminder that I donâ€™t have to start from scratch, thereâ€™s already a growing community of folks figuring this out together.
