I came across this one through the excellent [RDM Weekly](https://rdmweekly.substack.com/about) newsletter curated by Crystal Lewis and bookmarked it right away. It‚Äôs a quick, practical read on how to structure a project for clarity, collaboration, and long-term usability, all core to good research data management.

> A focused guide by Heidi Seibold on structuring research projects with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles in mind.

## Reflections

What stood out to me was how well this guide **balances structure with flexibility**. It‚Äôs not about rigid templates, it‚Äôs about building habits that make your work legible to others (and to your future self). The suggestions are approachable, practical, and easy to adapt across tools and teams.

A few highlights:

- Clear, simple folder and file naming conventions that lower the barrier to entry.
- Emphasis on project-level READMEs and contributor guides to make intent and roles transparent.
- Encouragement to keep things **tool-agnostic** and lightweight when possible, use formats and workflows that reduce dependency headaches.
- A reminder that **reproducibility isn‚Äôt just technical**, it‚Äôs about documentation, clarity, and making your work usable by people who weren‚Äôt there when it was built.

This post aligns really closely with how I‚Äôve been thinking about data work in collaborative research environments, where multiple people might touch the same pipeline (sometimes months apart). It‚Äôs also nudged me to revisit my own project templates and fill in some of the gaps I‚Äôve been meaning to address.

Definitely one I‚Äôll return to as I keep refining what ‚Äúgood infrastructure‚Äù looks like in my own work.
